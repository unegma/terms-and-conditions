# Terms and Conditions

## Parties

* Us/We/Our - Unegma
* You - the Client

## Code Usage/Ownership

You own the 'business logic' from which code is constructed. You own any code libraries/programs which are created especially to execute your business logic. We will sometimes use our own libraries within projects: these contain code, which usually performs common tasks, such as data access and data processing, and which could be used within any other project without exposing any client's unique business logic or sensitive data.

## Code validation

If appropriate, we will give you an opportunity to validate important algorithms before their usage. In these instances, if you or someone on your team, or an external third party, has the ability to verify important functionality before it is run on important data, then it is your responsibility to do so, and we will accept no responsibility for any oversight in these circumstances. 

If your team does not have the capabilities for extensive code audits, we will aim to work with you as closely as possible through a number of example scenarios, until both parties are confident that running a script on live data, will have as little potential for any unforseen consequences; In the case of an event such as this, we will aim to work with you as closely and quickly as possible to rectify any unintended consequences or circumstances.

## Backups and Data

We will aim to keep relevant data backed up, on your servers if possible. We aim not to use any of our own servers to keep data, as this makes a 'handover' difficult, and could also put us in a vulnerable position should there be a data breach. To best protect our clients' data, we ensure that our hard disks use encryption, and that we use strong passwords. We also use 2FA extensively where possible.

## Security

We will not be held liable for any compromise to your data in the event that a third party system, which we are contracted to work with, does not meet adequate security requirements. We will however be able to offer some advice to clients regarding security, and we will seek to do so in the case that a client is working with highly sensitive data. It is then entirely up to the discretion of the client to follow this up.

## Non Compete

Sometimes you may need us to work with your third party providers. We will not seek out our own contracts with your third party providers without your explicit approval whilst we are working for you, and for a pre-agreed period of time after. We will also not seek to employ a member of a client's staff should they leave the company, unless there is explicit approval.

## Brand Visibility

We are happy to work for you as an [Undisclosed Agent](https://www.google.com?q=undisclosed+agent) when working with third parties (you will provide an email account for usage). An additional fee will be added to cover any loss of opportunity for our brand promotion. Alternatively, we are happy to work with you as a strategic partner.
